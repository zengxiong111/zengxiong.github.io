 In this paper, we study the noise sensitiv-
ity of the semidefinite program (SDP) proposed for direct
data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR)
problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems.
While this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller
in the noise-free setting, we show that it leads to a trivial
solution with zero gain matrices when data is corrupted by
noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then
study a variant of the SDP that includes a robustness
promoting regularization term and prove that regularization
does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In particular,
the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability
also to a trivial solution.
