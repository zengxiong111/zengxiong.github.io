 Inspired by the work of Tsiamis et al. [1], in this
paper we study the statistical hardness of learning to stabilize
linear time-invariant systems. Hardness is measured by the
number of samples required to achieve a learning task with
a given probability. The work in [1] shows that there exist
system classes that are hard to learn to stabilize with the core
reason being the hardness of identification. Here we present
a class of systems that can be easy to identify, thanks to a
non-degenerate noise process that excites all modes, but the
sample complexity of stabilization still increases exponentially
with the system dimension. We tie this result to the hardness
of co-stabilizability for this class of systems using ideas from
robust control.
