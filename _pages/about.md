I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in UMich EECS department starting from 2021 Fall. I'm advised by Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/" target="_blank">Necmiye Ozay</a> and studying **some statistical fundamental limits of learning-based control algorithms and how to break these statistical limits by changing the dynamical system structure or the controller algorithm design**. Generally, we think about the statistical limits of a learning algorithm from the following three perspectives:
- **Statistical consistency**: Does the algorithm converge to the ground-truth solution with respect to sample size?[<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/pubs/ZengBO_acc25.pdf" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">ACC 2025</a>][<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19705" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">arXiv 2024</a>]
- **Statistical optimality**: Does the algorithm achieve the minimax sample complexity lower bound?[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16817" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">arXiv 2025</a>]
- **Statistical hardness**: Does the optimal sample complexity of the algorithm increase moderately with the system complexity?[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11151" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">CDC 2023</a>]
  
I'm also broadly interested in machine coffee, control theory, statistical learning theory, optimization, and robotics.

## Bio

I obtained my bachelor's degree from Automation Engineering Department of <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a> in 2020, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="http://yy311.github.io/" target="_blank">Ye Yuan</a>. After graduation, I took a gap year with my undergraduate advisor and Prof. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/profiles/jun-liu" target="_blank">Jun Liu</a> from University of Waterloo.

I was born and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudi" target="_blank">Loudi</a>, Hunan (湖南娄底), China.

## Misc

I like trail running, and people can often find me on the trails in Ann Arbor, day or night. My personal best record for the full marathon is 03:28:08 in the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon 2022. I have completed 2 <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/rim2rim2rim--2" target="_blank">Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim (R2R2R)</a> runs in the great <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/index.htm" target="_blank">Grand Canyon</a> with my friends. 

“士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。非淡泊无以明志，非宁静无以致远。从群众中来，到群众中去。”

English version of the above famous Chinese quotes (by ChatGPT): "A scholar must cultivate broad-mindedness and resilience, as the responsibilities are heavy and the journey is long. Without detachment, one cannot clarify one's aspirations; without tranquility, one cannot reach far. From people, for people."
