I'm working with Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/" target="_blank">Necmiye Ozay</a>. I'm broadly interested in machine coffee, optimization, control theory, statistical learning theory, and robotics. I'm studying the theoretical and practical fundamental limits of learning-based control algorithms.

I obtained my bachelor's degree from <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a>, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="http://yy311.github.io/" target="_blank">Ye Yuan</a>. After graduation, I took a gap year with my undergraduate advisor and Prof. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/profiles/jun-liu" target="_blank">Jun Liu</a> from University of Waterloo.

I was born and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudi" target="_blank">Loudi</a>, Hunan (湖南娄底), China.

I'm an active marathon and trail runner for Michigan AA Next Level Running Club. My personal best record for the full marathon is 03:28:08 in the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon 2022. I have completed a <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/rim2rim2rim--2" target="_blank">Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim (R2R2R)</a> run of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/index.htm" target="_blank">Grand Canyon</a> with my friends. 

“士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。非淡泊无以明志，非宁静无以致远。从群众中来，到群众中去。”

English version of the above famous Chinese quotes (by ChatGPT): "A scholar must cultivate broad-mindedness and resilience, as the responsibilities are heavy and the journey is long. Without detachment, one cannot clarify their aspirations; without tranquility, one cannot reach far. From the people, for the people."
