I'm working with Prof. Necmiye Ozay. <a href="[https://www.example.com](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/)" target="_blank">Necmiye Ozay</a> I'm broadly interested in machine coffee, optimization, control theory, statistical learning theory, and robotics. I'm studying the theoretical and practical fundamental limits of learning-based control algorithms.  

I'm an active marathon and trail runner for Michigan AA Next Level Running Club. My personal best record for the full marathon is 03:28:08 in the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon 2022.

士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。非淡泊无以明志，非宁静无以致远。从群众中来，到群众中去。

English version of the three famous Chinese quotes (by Chatgpt): "A scholar must have a broad mind and strong resolve, for the responsibilities are heavy and the path is long. Without being indifferent to worldly desires, one cannot clarify one's purpose; without remaining calm and composed, one cannot reach far. From the people, for the people."
