I'm working with Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/" target="_blank">Necmiye Ozay</a>. I'm broadly interested in machine coffee, optimization, control theory, statistical learning theory, and robotics. I'm studying the theoretical and practical fundamental limits of learning-based control algorithms.  

I'm an active marathon and trail runner for Michigan AA Next Level Running Club. My personal best record for the full marathon is 03:28:08 in the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon 2022.

士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。非淡泊无以明志，非宁静无以致远。从群众中来，到群众中去。

English version of the above famous Chinese quotes (by ChatGPT): "A scholar must cultivate broad-mindedness and resilience, as the responsibilities are heavy and the journey is long. Without detachment, one cannot clarify their aspirations; without tranquility, one cannot reach far. From the people, for the people."
