I‘m a fifth-year Ph.D. student in UMich ECE department starting in the fall of 2021. I'm advised by Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/" target="_blank">Necmiye Ozay</a>. 

## Research

Unlike the cyberspace of ChatGPT, in the physical world, **infinitesimal parameter error or noise** might lead to catastrophic 
failures in **stability and safety**. Therefore, our **system design and algorithm design** should be robust to parameter error and noise. Motivated by these, we focus on studying some **statistical fundamental limits** of learning for **dynamics and control**, and how to break these fundamental limits by changing the dynamical system structure or the algorithm paradigm. Generally, we think about the statistical limits of a data-driven algorithm from the following three perspectives in order:
- **Statistical consistency**: Does the algorithm converge to the ground-truth solution under noise?[<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~necmiye/pubs/ZengBO_acc25.pdf" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">ACC 2025</a>][<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19705" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">Journal Submission 2025</a> (direct data-driven control)]
- **Statistical optimality**: If the algorithm is statistically consistent, does it achieve the minimax sample complexity lower bound?[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16817" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">L-CSS and CDC 2025</a> (system identification)]
- **Statistical hardness**: If the algorithm is statistically optimal, does the optimal sample complexity increase moderately with the system complexity?[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11151" style="color: blue;" target="_blank">CDC 2023</a> (learning to stabilize)]

I'm also passionate about **machine coffee** and **learning-based control system design** on any scale.

## Bio

I obtained my bachelor's degree from the Automation Department of <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science and Technology</a> in 2020, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="http://yy311.github.io/" target="_blank">Ye Yuan</a>. After graduation, I took a gap year with my undergraduate advisor and Prof. <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/profiles/jun-liu" target="_blank">Jun Liu</a> from University of Waterloo.

I was born and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudi" target="_blank">Loudi</a>, Hunan (湖南娄底), China.

## Misc

I like trail running, and people can often find me on the trails and hills in Ann Arbor, day or night. My personal best record for the full marathon is 03:28:08 in the Indianapolis Monumental Marathon 2022. I have completed 2 <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/rim2rim2rim--2" target="_blank">Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim (R2R2R)</a> runs in the great <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/index.htm" target="_blank">Grand Canyon</a> with my friends. 

“士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远。非淡泊无以明志，非宁静无以致远。从群众中来，到群众中去。”

English version of the above famous Chinese quotes (by ChatGPT): "A scholar must cultivate broad-mindedness and resilience, as the responsibilities are heavy and the journey is long. Without nonattachment, one cannot clarify one's aspirations; without tranquility, one cannot reach far. From people, for people."
